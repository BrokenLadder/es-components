Spinners can be sized how you like, but their contents will always be an exact circle.

They can be sized to the outer container:
```
<div style={{width: 100, height: 100}}>
  <Spinner />
</div>
```

You can manually set width and height:
```
<div>
  <Spinner width="65px" height="65px" />
</div>
```


You can set the size based on a percentage:
```
<div style={{width: 100, height: 100}}>
  <Spinner width="50%" />
</div>

```
